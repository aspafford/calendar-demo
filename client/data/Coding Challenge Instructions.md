We love calendars.
 
Your challenge, should you choose to accept, is to create a calendar showing a *single day's* worth of timeslots. In our world, a `Timeslot` is a bookable activity that occurs at a given moment in time. You may use any front-end tools you like, but keep in mind we are an Ember shop and if nothing else, love single-page-apps!
 
Attached to this GIST there are a few JSON files containing `Timeslots`. "Day 1", "Day 2" and "Day 3" each contain different arrangements, with an increasing degree of difficulty. Start with Day 1 and move up as time permits.

Please provide a public URL + a gitrepo. Committing often helps us see how you think - we like that!
 
Extra Credit:
- "All Three Days" combines the three days together for bonus points if you want to do a full week view!
- feel free to make your own JSON file with a bunch of timeslots if you want to show off your app's performance with a ton of data.
- the timeslots have some information (activity name, number of spots, etc) incorporate it in an intuitive way!
- make the timeslots draggable so as you drag them the overlapping timeslots update. (obviously persisting the changes is out of scope!)
- writing tests for front-end code can be challenging, show us you've done it before!
- anything else you think we'll get a kick out of seeing!
